Who am I ?

I am [@BMG_111](https://x.com/BMG_111) on X (Twitter)

You can find my [Github](https://github.com/bhavansh) here

I do programming for work (and fun ofcourse). I code primiarily in java and have started my journey to learn and explore other things as well now. I prefer to solve problems that i encounter (mostly automating things that I am too lazy to do manually  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` ).

Currently working with Java and very familiar with Python, SQL, bash.

I am currently based out GMT+05:30 and will be based out of GMT-05:00 within the next 10 years (At least thats the goal).
